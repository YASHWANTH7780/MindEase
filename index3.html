  <h2>Our approaches</h2>
  <p>We have 2 approaches for this app as of now:
    Realistic Approach - 
    In the realistic approach, we have a website and a prototype of the app in which user can do a drill and rate their day
    on a scale of 1-9 ducks, hence gamifying the experience
    
    Based on the number picked by the self aware user, we will be assigning a set of activities they can perform to help
    feel better.
    
    Each user will also have an profile which have their goals, affirmations, weeks rating etc
  
    Futuristic Approach -
    in this approach, we aim to amplify the scale of this project and add a prompt for users to write a para on why they
    decided to rate their day like that, further we will have other metrics the user will have to fill so that we can use
    them as constraints and use NLP for the text inputted and analyze behavior, hence recommending better activities
    
    This will also come with features to join classes via app, listen to calming music, finding a guru etc
